Lab5 - step1
A description of step 1 and it's difference from threadHello.c

When I run the program, the threads each execute sequentially, and return sequentially. This differs from threadHello.c
as threadHello.c had no protection (ie synchronization) of its critical section, so multiple threads would execute at the same time
with the same index, leading to multiple threads sharing the same index.
