Title: Lab3 - step 6 and 7 observations
Description: Observations of step6 output

After compiling and running the code ten threads are created, but some are given the same index number.
This is because the threads run both simultaneously and share memory. The threads are not properly synced
and that's why this discrepancy appeared.

This was solved by making the process sleep for 100 microseconds after each thread creation and before each iteration.
