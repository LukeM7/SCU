Lab 6
Describes how to do the lab using ftp in Minix

After opening your virtual desktop, open the terminal and enter "setup vmware".
Then enter "minix-get-image". When completed, enter "vmware &" and wait for vmware to open.
Open "Minix 3" in vmware. Enter "root" as the username, and then type "passwd" to set up a root
password. Now after logging in enter "ipconfig". Open another terminal window an enter
"ftp <ipconfig ip address>". Log in using root and the password you set up. Now enter
"cd usr/src/kernel". Then enter "get main.c". Open your user directory in your virtual desktop
and modify the main.c file that has been copied there. Add a print statement to the announcement
function of your choosing. Save and go back to the terminal window using ftp. Enter "put main.c".
Now go back to your minix VM and in the /usr/src directory enter "make world". When the command
is finished enter "reboot" and you will see your added printf on startup.
