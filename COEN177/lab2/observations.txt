Upon exeucting the program I immediately got a segmentation fault.
After re-running it with a command line arguement of 3000 the program 
executed correctly. When using delays of 500 the program printed each 
process much faster than before, and when using 5000 it printed slower
than with 3000ms delay.

I found that for step 5 it was best to do the forking within a separate function.
I originally tried using a for loop within main, but that method ending up proving
wrong as I couldn't successfully fork the right amount of times using loops given
the nature of forking.

For step 6 threading proved to be far easier for me than forking. I used another thread to
run a child process, and after using the documentation was able to pretty easily
finish the step.

Step 7 only required me to erase the original parent process conditional from the first step
and add the code the lab described. This allowed the child process to execute the ls command
and for the parent to wait for it to finish.
