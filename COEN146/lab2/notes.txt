Notes about the Lab2

Step 1:
Using the API functions made copying pretty easy. The challenge came from figuring out how to copy
files that used a buffer that was not a multiple of the file size. This was solved by checking if the reader
had made it to the end of the file, and calculating the remaining bytes that were needed to properly copy over.
This avoided a copy with a larger size than the original.

Step2:
Using system calls I was able to avoid the problem of step1. Instead I could just use simple read and write calls
that wouldn't go over like the system functions did.

Step3:
Each type of copy was clocked to last 0.0000s. I presume this means it was able to be copied extremely fast using either method.

Step4:
A copy thread function was created that used the step1 implementation to copy. I passed the index of the for loop that would execute
each thread so each thread had a corresponding file to copy. I could then modify the number of the file name being copied since each
the same name but a different number.
