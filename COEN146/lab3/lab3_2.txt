Lab 3 - Step 2
Pings 3 different internet hosts, each from a different continent. Identifies the packet loss, RTT, and the correlation
between these measurements.

a)
	google.com: 0% packet loss
	hostuk.org: 0% packet loss
	yandex.ru: 0% packet loss

b)
	google.com: 2.384ms average RTT
	hostuk.org: 137.977ms average RTT
	yandex.ru: 176.449ms average RTT

c) Packet loss remained at 0% as the connection managed to exist uninterrupted. RTT was much longer depending on how far the
server being pinged was from my system. hostuk.org was closer than yandex.ru, so the average RTT was smaller. google.com on the
other hand is much closer, and thus the average RTT is significantly lower than either of the others.
