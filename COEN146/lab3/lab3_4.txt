Observations of connecting to a server using telnet

a) Launching this command connects me with the umass web server. I can then enter commands which appear to be HTTP requests.

b) Entering this GET request displays the contents of that webpage in code (HTML, JS, etc).

c) 
- index.php
- HTTP 1.1
- Text is formatted in HTML, pictures are formatted as hrefs.
